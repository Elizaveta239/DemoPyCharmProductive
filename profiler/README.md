**Like this project?**

You might also like my other Minecraft clone written in C using modern OpenGL (GL shader language). It performs better, has better terrain generation and saves state to a sqlite database. See here:

## Goals and Vision

I would like to see this project turn into an educational tool. Kids love Minecraft and Python is a great first language.
This is a good opportunity to get children excited about programming.

The code should become well commented and more easily configurable. It should be easy to make some simple changes
and see the results quickly.

I think it would be great to turn the project into more of a library / API... a Python package that you import and then
use / configure to setup a world and run it. Something along these lines...

    import mc
    
    world = mc.World(...)
    world.set_block(x, y, z, mc.DIRT)
    mc.run(world)

The API could contain functionality for the following:

- Easily configurable parameters like gravity, jump velocity, walking speed, etc.
- Hooks for terrain generation.

## How to Run

    pip install pyglet
    git clone https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft.git
    cd Minecraft
    python main.py

### Mac

On Mac OS X, you may have an issue with running Pyglet in 64-bit mode. Try running Python in 32-bit mode first:

    arch -i386 python main.py

If that doesn't work, set Python to run in 32-bit mode by default:

    defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Prefer-32-Bit -bool yes 

This assumes you are using the OS X default Python.  Works on Lion 10.7 with the default Python 2.7, and may work on other versions too.  Please raise an issue if not.
    
Or try Pyglet 1.2 alpha, which supports 64-bit mode:  

    pip install https://pyglet.googlecode.com/files/pyglet-1.2alpha1.tar.gz 

### If you don't have pip or git

For pip:

- Mac or Linux: install with `sudo easy_install pip` (Mac or Linux) - or (Linux) find a package called something like 'python-pip' in your package manager.
- Windows: [install Distribute then Pip](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12476379/992887) using the linked .MSI installers.

For git:

- Mac: install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) first, then `brew install git`.
- Windows or Linux: see [Installing Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) from the _Pro Git_ book.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft/wiki) for this project to install Python, and other tips.
