Rename Symbol

Change a variable name, class name, or other symbol, across the
project.

- ``Greeter`` is used in many places, but we want to change to
  ``Welcomer``
- Navigate to Symbol with Cmd-B
- Create New file (Ctrl Alt N) with class Greeter
- Ctrl-T | Rename -> ``Welcomer``
- Left-bracket back to code
- **** UNDO **** puts ``Greeter`` back everywhere
- Could also rename from here
- Works on *symbols* not strings
